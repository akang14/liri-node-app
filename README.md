# liri-node-app
The problem this app is trying to solve is using the terminal to search up a song/movie title to display information on requested titles.

HOW IT WORKS:
 
 1. spotify-this-song
 entering the command "node liri.js spotify-this-song song-name" into the terminal, it should display all the information needed about the song.
 
 2. movie-this
  entering the command "node liri.js movie-this movie-title" into the terminal, it should display all the information needed about the movie using axios and the OMDB API.
  
  3. do-what-it-says
   entering the command "node liri.js do-what-it-says" into the terminal, and it should read text from the separate txt file created.
